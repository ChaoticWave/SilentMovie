## About SilentMovie
Silent Movie is a small web application that allows you to analyze media data. The app knows how to talk to various online media systems to retrieve pertinent details. This information is then stored in an [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack) for analysis. How you analyze the data is up to you. This application just gets it there.
