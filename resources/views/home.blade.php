                <p>Silent Movie is a small web application that allows you to analyze media data. The app knows how to talk to various online media systems to
                    retrieve pertinent details. This information is then stored in an Elastic Stack for analysis. How you analyze the data is up to you. This
                    application just gets it there.</p>
                <p>Silent Movie is completely free, open source, and can be used for any purpose. The project is freely available on GitHub at
                    <a href="https://github.com/ChaoticWave/SilentMovie/" target="_blank">https://github.com/ChaoticWave/SilentMovie/</a></p>
